								Andy started his musical journey when the character he played in a high school play was required to play acoustic guitar. His early influences were, and still are, The Beatles, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and Cat Stevens. Shortly after high school, he and Doug co-founded and formed the 50s and 60s group Midnight Sun. This evolved into a country band before eventually disbanding. It wasn't long before he and Doug launched 2nd Generation. Early on 2G backed up Dash Riprock regularly at the Withrow Ballroom.

								18 years after co-founding the group, Doug continues to carry the bottom for 2nd Generation with his great R & B style and solid technique. Growing up in the 60s and 70s, his influences were everything from Motown to McCartney. In addition to his musical contribution to the band, Doug's technical expertise and experience in the area of sound production and equipment acquisition continues to keep the band's sound values on the cutting edge.
